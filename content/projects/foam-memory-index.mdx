# Foam Memory Index

Exploring the retention of structure in transient mediums.

## The Nature of Foam

Foam is fundamentally unstable. Its structure exists in a state of perpetual collapse, each bubble a temporary vault holding air against gravity and surface tension. Yet within this transience lies a peculiar form of memory.

## Digital Parallels

When we create digital structures that mimic foam—translucent, cellular, breathing—we're not just rendering aesthetics. We're encoding a philosophy about how information should exist: **visible but not insistent, structured but not rigid, present but not permanent**.

## Implementation Notes

Using Marching Cubes and Gyroid SDFs, I've been exploring how to capture this ephemeral quality in Three.js. The challenge is making something that feels *alive* without overwhelming the viewer.

```glsl
// Gyroid SDF for foam-like structures
float gyroid(vec3 p) {
    return dot(sin(p), cos(p.yzx));
}
```

The key is in the subtlety—enough movement to suggest life, not enough to distract from thought.
